Lox is a programming language designed to be implemented for educational
purposes. The steps to create an interpreter for it are described in [this book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Since copy-pasting source code isn't really stimulating the author provided each
chapter with some challenges. Solutions to the challenges are not found in the book.

Bellow I want to showcase my solutions to the various problems that the author
of the book proposed.
