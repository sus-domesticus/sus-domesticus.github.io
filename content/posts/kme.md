[This project](https://github.com/MGreek/kme) contains the source code for a
web-app which combines a keyboard-centric workflow with **GUI**
elements to serve as an engraver of sheet music.

More traditional approaches use widgets and other **GUI** elements to act upon
the piece of music (check out [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en)). Others like
[LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/) take the programmer route and provide
and a compiler which generates music from a source file.

While far from being as complete as the previous two examples, this app can still
be used to engrave certain types of pieces. Its strength is quickly drafting sheet
music but not necessarily chiseling the finer details.

Below is a showcase of some of its features.
