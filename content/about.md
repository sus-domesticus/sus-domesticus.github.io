My name is Marc and I recently graduated from [**U.B.B.**](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/en/)
with a B.S. in Computer Science.

I'm interested in various areas of computer science:

* **Unix**-like operating systems (working in the terminal,
properly maintaining a system, etc.)

* Open-source software

* Desktop and web-development

* good old algorithms and data structures ([infoarena](https://infoarena.ro/)
is a great place to find challenges)

As for non-technical stuff, in my free time I like to study music :musical_note:,
game :video_game: and play tennis :tennis: or do other sports.

Thank you for reading!
